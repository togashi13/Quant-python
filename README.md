# Quant-python

## Introduction
This project is a collection of short python program I wrote during bootcamp.

## python basics
We learned about python datatypes,
if-elif-else conditionals, for and while loops, lists and tuples, and list comprehensions.

Here is my [basics Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/togashi13/Quant-python/blob/master/python-basics-notebook-empty.ipynb).

## python secret project
